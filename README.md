# Pitch
The built envrionment is probably one of the most interesting assets of New yYork city. 
The big apple presents and incredible variety of buildings, continously changing its skyline and producing new architectural landcape. 
But what are the forces behind these transformations? Who's driving the change? 
Looking at the built envrionment we can tell what direction the city is taking and perhaps predict how it will look
like in the future, not only in architectural terms but also from a social and cultural perspective. 
Our publication would not only tell story of urban development but would visualize the conflicts, the tensions behind the bustling 
metropolis. 
Take for example de Blasio housing plan, we can visualize the plan but also overlap it with other indicators 
and find out how the plan responds to the actual needs of the city. 
Downtown Brooklyn is another interestin case, skyscapers have transformed the area making it as shadowy as it never been. 
Who are those building for, who's winning who's loosing in that transformation. 
Our website would explain and show the invisible infrastructures of New York that few people actually get to know.
